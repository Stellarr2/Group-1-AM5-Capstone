Make-to-Order is a production strategy in which goods are manufactured once a confirmed customer order is received.
Unlike make-to-stock (where products are produced ahead of demand), MTO focuses resources on fulfilling **specific customer requests**.
This project simulates that lifecycle and produces a dataset you can analyze in the dashboard.

A Sales Order is the original order from a customer. It contains the customer name, product (or product line),
quantity, unit price, order date, and a free-form STATUS field that will drive business decisions.
In batch mode the app expects CSV rows with columns such as `CUSTOMERNAME`, `PRODUCTLINE`, `QUANTITYORDERED`, `PRICEEACH`, `ORDERDATE`, `STATUS`.
